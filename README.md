# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview

This machine learning project predicts house prices using Linear Regression based on features like:
- Average number of rooms
- % of lower-income population
- Student-teacher ratio, etc.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **File**: `housing.csv`
- **Source**: [Kaggle / UCI ML Repo / Provided by instructor]
- **Target Variable**: `MEDV` – Median value of homes in $1000s
- **Features**:
  - `RM` – Avg. number of rooms per dwelling
  - `LSTAT` – % lower status population
  - `PTRATIO` – Pupil-teacher ratio by town

## 🚀 Project Steps

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Missing value handling
3. Feature selection
4. Model training using Linear Regression
5. Evaluation using:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score (Accuracy)
6. Visualization of actual vs predicted prices
